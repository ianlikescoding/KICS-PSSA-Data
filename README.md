# KICS Project -DBMS-

Motivation-

Each year PA students take standarized test to measure school performance. After research we have found that the score of PSSA test have an impact on school fundings from the state. Therefore, we wante to visualize the correlation of favrious factors and PSSA scores. This will not only help people who are planning to go to higher education, but also their gurdians/parents as well to be used as another resource to decide where to send their kids.
